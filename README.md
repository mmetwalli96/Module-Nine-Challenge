## Overview of The Project
--- 

In order to insure the stability of the business year around, the temperatures during he months of June and December need to be analyzed. This will aid in the decision making process and if there will be need to any sort of adjustments to support the operation of the business.

## Results
---

Here are key differences between the months of June and December based on the below figures:

- The number of counts in the month of June is greater than the month of December which indicates that the number of recorded days for each month is not equal. 
- The temperature during June is high than Decemeber which is expected as December is the month when winter starts and fall ends.
- Calculating the coefficient of variation, which is the standard variation value divided by the mean, results in a values less than one. This indicates that most of the measured temperatures are close to the mean temperature. 

## Sumary
---

To summarize, the main findings are the number of counts in the month of June is greater than the month of December, the temperature during June is high than Decemeber, and most of the measured temperatures are close to the mean temperature. Further possible queries are 
- retrieving the percepetation data of the months of June and Decemebr. 
- obtaining the temperature data of April and October to analyze the business during spring and autumn.
